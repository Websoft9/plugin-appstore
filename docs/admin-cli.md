# AWX CLI

## About

AWX is the official command-line client for AWX and Red Hat Ansible Tower. It:

* Uses naming and structure consistent with the AWX HTTP API
* Provides consistent output formats with optional machine-parsable formats
* To the extent possible, auto-detects API versions, available endpoints, and feature support across multiple versions of AWX and Red Hat Ansible Tower.

Potential uses include:

* Configuring and launching jobs/playbooks
* Checking on the status and output of job runs
* Managing objects like organizations, users, teams, etc…
